/**
 * A thread-safe, dynamically growing array designed for a write-once-read-many (WORM) pattern.
 *
 * <p>Writes can be performed concurrently from multiple threads using {@link #put(Object)}.
 * Once all writes are complete, call {@link #finish()} to seal the array and obtain an immutable,
 * fixed-size snapshot for reading.</p>
 *
 * <p>This structure assumes two distinct phases:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Writing phase:</strong> Multiple threads may call {@link #put(Object)} concurrently.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Reading phase:</strong> After calling {@link #finish()}, only read operations are allowed via
 *       {@link #get(int)}, or streaming methods like {@link #stream()} and {@link #parallelStream()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The array is dynamically resized if needed during writes. Resizing is rare and synchronized internally,
 * but has minimal impact on throughput when the final size is preallocated.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link #finish()} blocks until all pending writes have completed before returning the final array.</p>
 *
 * @param <X> the type of elements stored in this array
